# Steps for Developing Applications in Hyperledger Fabric

Similar to Ethereum development, building applications with Hyperledger involves the following steps:

1. **Installing Hyperledger Fabric**
2. **Setting the ledger**
3. **Issuing identity** to participants (peers and orderer)
4. **Setting the channel**
5. **Defining Access Control Lists (ACL)**
6. **Writing chaincode**
7. **Installing chaincode**
8. **Invoking chaincode**
9. **Creating APIs** for client applications

### Access Control List (ACL)

* ACL is a **set of rules** used in Fabric.
* It defines and manages **access** to different resources/entities within a Fabric network.
