// This is to explain the concept of loops in Go

/*

Once Alice and Eron had learned about variables, arrays, and conditionals, they continued on their journey and came across a great challenge. They needed to traverse through a dark forest that seemed to go on forever.

Eron explained to Alice that they could use loops in Go programming to navigate through the forest. Loops are a powerful tool in programming that allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly.

To help Alice understand, Eron showed her a code example that demonstrated the concept of loops in Go. In the example, they used a for loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 10.

package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    for i := 1; i <= 10; i++ {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
}


/*

Eron explained to Alice that a for loop consists of three parts: the initialization statement, the condition, and the post statement. The initialization statement sets the starting value of the loop variable, the condition specifies when the loop should stop, and the post statement updates the loop variable after each iteration.

Alice was fascinated by the concept of loops and how they could be used to solve complex problems. She asked Eron how loops could be used to navigate through the forest.

Eron smiled and said, "Well, we can use loops to repeatedly check for the presence of obstacles and change our direction if necessary. With Go programming, we have the flexibility to navigate through any forest, no matter how dark and treacherous."

Alice was excited by the possibilities and eager to continue learning about Go programming and the power of Verseium. She knew that with her newfound knowledge of loops and programming, she could overcome any challenge that came her way.
