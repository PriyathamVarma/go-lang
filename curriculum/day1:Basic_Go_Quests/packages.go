// This is to explain the concept of packages in Go

/* As Alice continued on her quest to learn Go programming, she came across a new code snippet. The code looked like this: */

package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello World")
}


/*
Alice was intrigued by this code and wanted to learn more about it. She asked Eron, her mentor, to explain it to her.

Eron smiled and said, "This code is a simple Go program that prints the message 'Hello World' to the console. Let me explain it to you."

"The first line, 'package main', is a declaration that this is a standalone executable program, as opposed to a library that can be used by other programs," Eron continued.

"The 'import' statement brings in a package called 'fmt', which stands for 'format'. This package contains functions for formatting and printing text," Eron explained.

"The 'func main()' is the entry point of the program. It's the first function that gets called when the program runs," Eron said. "And finally, 'fmt.Println("Hello World")' is a call to the 'Println' function from the 'fmt' package, which prints the message 'Hello World' to the console."

Alice nodded, understanding the code better now. "So this is a simple program, but it shows how we can use packages and functions to write Go code that does something useful," she said.

Eron smiled. "Exactly! And as you learn more about Go programming, you'll discover how to write more complex programs that can do even more amazing things."
